    "- **Dropping rows or columns:** Useful if the amount of missing data is small and won't cause significant information loss.\n",
    "- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:** Replacing missing values with the mean (for numerical, normally distributed data), median (for numerical, skewed data), or mode (for categorical data) of the respective column. This is a simple approach but can reduce variance and distort relationships between variables.\n",
